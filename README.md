Has it ever bothered you that the VAB/SPH was always stuck in day time, even in the middle of the night? Well, I got sick of forgetting that I clicked on the VAB at night and forgot until a half hour later when I launched, so I made this mod. Plus I just thought it would be cool. With this mod, the background in the VAB and SPH will be in either a day or night mode, depending on what time you enter it. You can manually change between day and night mode too, by clicking on the toolbar button or pressing ALT+N. Note that time still does not pass while in the editor.

Known Issues:
Sometimes you might see the background flicker when you switch between the SPH to the VAB as the mod rehides some lights. It's usually pretty quick though.

Compatiablity:
Should be compabible with most editor mods that don't adjust the lighting of the VAB.
I've used it with the Hangar extender mod without issue.
Please let me know if you find any mods that don't appear to be compabable.

Credits:
Thanks a bunch to the creators of the LightsOut mod, which provided both the inspiration and technical implimentation nessesary for me to figure out how to create this mod. In particular the skybox code was very helpful. Also the Kerbal Object Inspector mod was very nice for testing changes in game. I Wish I had found it sooner in this mod's development.
